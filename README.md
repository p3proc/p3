# p3 - an extensible preprocessing pipeline

p3 is an extensible preprocessing pipeline that encourages
experimentation and customization. In addition to providing a BIDS-compatible preprocessing
pipeline for users, it also provides a platform to quickly and easily integrate new
processing methods into an neuroimaging processing stream.

Powered by the nipype project, p3 takes advantage of the cross package python interface
it provides, allowing users to use a variety of neuroimaging software in their pipelines from
one standard interface. The nipype concepts of nodes and workflows allows users to construct
processing streams in an intuitive manner.
