p3 processing pipeline

positional arguments:
  bids_dir              The directory with the input dataset formatted
                        according to the BIDS standard.
  output_dir            The directory where the output files should be stored.
                        If you are running group level analysis this folder
                        should be prepopulated with the results of the
                        participant level analysis.
  {participant,group}   Level of the analysis that will be performed. Multiple
                        participant level analyses can be run independently
                        (in parallel) using the same output_dir. (Note: group
                        flag is currently disabled since there are not any
                        group level functionalities in this pipeline
                        currently. This is set to 'participant' by default and
                        can be omitted.)

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --participant_label PARTICIPANT_LABEL [PARTICIPANT_LABEL ...]
                        The label(s) of the participant(s) that should be
                        analyzed.The label corresponds to
                        sub-<participant_label> from the BIDS spec (so it does
                        not include "sub-"). If this parameter is not provided
                        all subjects should be analyzed. Multiple participants
                        can be specified with a space separated list.
  --skip_bids_validator
                        Whether or not to perform BIDS dataset validation
  -v, --version         show program's version number and exit
  -s SETTINGS, --settings SETTINGS
                        A JSON settings file that specifies how the pipeline
                        should be configured. If no settings file is provided,
                        the pipeline will use internally specified defaults.
                        See docs for more help details.
  -g GENERATE_SETTINGS, --generate_settings GENERATE_SETTINGS
                        Generates a default settings file in the provided
                        directory for use/modification. This option will
                        ignore all other arguments.
  --summary             Get a summary of the BIDS dataset input.
  --disable_run         Stop after writing graphs. Does not run pipeline.
                        Useful for making sure your workflow is connected
                        properly before running.
  -w WORKFLOWS [WORKFLOWS ...], --workflows WORKFLOWS [WORKFLOWS ...]
                        Other paths p3 should search for workflows. Note that
                        you should have an empty __init__.py so that the
                        directory is importable.
  -c CREATE_NEW_WORKFLOW, --create_new_workflow CREATE_NEW_WORKFLOW
                        Creates workflow template at provided path.
  -m, --multiproc       Runs pipeline in multiprocessing mode. Note that it is
                        harder to debug when this option is on.
  -d, --verbose         Enable verbose debugging mode.
